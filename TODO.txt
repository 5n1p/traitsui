* Custom style of CheckListEditor does not update correctly when the object
  trait changes

* Text style of ColorEditor does not update correctly when edited (object trait
  updates, editor color does not)

* Simple style InstanceEditor is broken--pressing button does nothing.

* Tabbed group layout does not remember the select tab when it is reloaded (this
  can be observed by running the Traits UI Demo application)

* TabularEditor does handle tuple style color specifications (easy to fix, see
  TableEditor)

* Readonly style TextEditor has wrapping problems (observe status text in
  "Invalid state handling" Advanced Demo)

================
Missing features
================

Implemented in the wx backend, and must be implemented for compatibility:

* ArrayViewEditor is not implemented. Trivial: see wx version of the editor.

* DateEditor is not implemented. Use QDateEdit.

* HistoryEditor is not implemented.

* ImageEnumEditor is not implemented. A standard enum editor get used instead.

* ListStrEditor is not implemented. Use QListWidget.

* PopupEditor is not implemented. It is questionable whether this even worth
  implementing, as it makes for very unconventional, and therefore confusing,
  user interfaces.

* ScrubberEditor is not implemented. Again, may not be worth implementing.

* Features missing from the TableEditor:
  * Searching and filtering, both model level support and UI
  * Adding new items
  * Deleting items items
  * Reordering items (both manually and by sorting)

* Features missing from the TabularEditor:
  * right_clicked and right_dclicked events
  * Drag and drop
  * Editable labels (column headers)
  * Adding new items
  * Deleting existing items
  * Reordering items (manually)
  * Lazy loading of data (compare performance of "NumPy array tabular editor
    demo" with wx backend)

* TimeEditor not implemented. Use QTimeEdit.

============
Enhancements
============

Not implemented in the wx backend, but would be nice to have anyway:

* Create option for ColorEditor that does not show the RGB value of the
  color. This would allow for much more compact widgets, which is preferable in
  some cases.
