Missing features
================

Implemented in the wx backend, and must be implemented for compatibility:

* Features missing from DateEditor:
  * 'multi_select' and its associated options. See
    http://www.qtsoftware.com/developer/faqs/faq.2007-11-06.6144759363 for info.
  * 'padding', although this probably shouldn't be supported.

* HistoryEditor is not implemented.

* Features missing from the ListStrEditor:
  * 'auto_add' factory option
  * 'right_clicked' and 'right_clicked_index' factory options

* PopupEditor is not implemented. It is questionable whether this even worth
  implementing, as it makes for very unconventional, and therefore confusing,
  user interfaces.

* ScrubberEditor is not implemented. Again, may not be worth implementing.

* Features missing from the TableEditor:
  * Searching
  * Storing table state (custom filters and column widths)
  * 'sort_model' option for sorting
  * 'selected_indices' option for item selection
  * Factory options for cell color, font, etc. These options are currently only
    supported through TableColumns.

* Features missing from the TabularEditor:
  * 'right_clicked' and 'right_dclicked' events
  * Drag and drop
  * Editable labels (column headers)
  * Adding new items
  * Deleting existing items
  * Reordering items

============
Enhancements
============

Low priority items. Not implemented in the wx backend, but would be nice to have
anyway:

* Create option for ColorEditor that does not show the RGB value of the color.
  This would allow for much more compact widgets, which is preferable in some
  cases.

* TableEditor:

  * The filter dialog is better than the wx one, but there is still room for
    improvement. In particular, the add/remove buttons should be replaced with
    toolbar icons, and the add button should have a drop-down menu when pressed
    for selecting which template to use. This is better than the always-present
    EnumEditor for tempate selection because templates are clearly associated 
    with the creation of new filters.
