* Custom style of CheckListEditor does not update correctly when the object
  trait changes

* Text style of ColorEditor does not update correctly when edited (object trait
  updates, editor color does not)

* Tabbed group layout does not remember the selected tab when it is reloaded
  (this can be observed by running the Traits UI Demo application, selecting the
  demo view tab for a demo, and then clicking on a new demo in the tree).

* Readonly style TextEditor has wrapping problems (observe status text in
  "Invalid state handling" Advanced Demo)

================
Missing features
================

Implemented in the wx backend, and must be implemented for compatibility:

* ArrayViewEditor is not implemented. Trivial: see wx version of the editor.

* DateEditor is not implemented. Use QDateEdit.

* HistoryEditor is not implemented.

* ImageEnumEditor is not implemented. A standard enum editor get used instead.

* ListStrEditor is not implemented. Use QListView.

* PopupEditor is not implemented. It is questionable whether this even worth
  implementing, as it makes for very unconventional, and therefore confusing,
  user interfaces.

* ScrubberEditor is not implemented. Again, may not be worth implementing.

* Features missing from the TableEditor:
  * Searching
  * Storing table state (custom filters and column widths)
  * Context menus for cells
  * 'sort_model' option for sorting
  * 'selected_indices' option for item selection
  * Factory options for cell color, font, etc. These options are currently only
    supported through TableColumns.

* Features missing from the TabularEditor:
  * 'right_clicked' and 'right_dclicked' events
  * Drag and drop
  * Editable labels (column headers)
  * Adding new items
  * Deleting existing items
  * Reordering items
  * Lazy loading of data (compare performance of "NumPy array tabular editor
    demo" with wx backend)

* TimeEditor not implemented. Use QTimeEdit.

============
Enhancements
============

Low priority items. Not implemented in the wx backend, but would be nice to have
anyway:

* Create option for ColorEditor that does not show the RGB value of the
  color. This would allow for much more compact widgets, which is preferable in
  some cases.

* TableEditor:

  * The filter dialog is better than the wx one, but there is still room for
    improvement. In particular, the add/remove buttons should be replaced with
    toolbar icons, and the add button should have a drop-down menu when pressed
    for selecting which template to use. This is better than the always-present
    EnumEditor for tempate selection because templates are clearly associated 
    with the creation of new filters.
